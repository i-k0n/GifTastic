## How does it work?
You can enter a color into the search bar and add it to the pre-defined list of colors if you'd like. Autocomplete can help you if you aren't sure if a color's name, that's okay! There are hundreds of colors to choose from! If you just can't settle on a color, or if you just want to let chance decide for you, you can click the random buttom to add a random color to the list. Don't like the colors you were given at the start? Simply refresh the page to get a new set.

Click on any color to search the Giphy database and receive 15 gifs related to that color. Click on another color to see gifs related to it instead.

## Okay, but why?
Colors inspire me. I love the way colors look when placed next to other colors. Contrast, gradients, compliments, analogous; all ways to display colors for a different feeling. The preset list of colors are laid out in families of like-colors, greens, reds, browns, etc. Not only is it an attractive way to display colors, but it's a great way to explore all the facets of one hue. Sure there are many more colors than the ones given, but I think it's a good place to start.

Give it a shot, and see what you think!
